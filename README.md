Paste flights from Google Flights, airline sites, emails or screenshots —
get a perfect, copy-paste-ready **GDS Black Window itinerary**.

**[Open / Deploy](#deploy)** · Made by **Adham Badran** — SpicyTerminal

## Why

One job, done perfectly. A deterministic offline engine — real IATA
aircraft codes, 12-hour GDS clocks, overnight markers, exact booking-class
handling, hidden-stop merging, one chronological ticket order. No
hallucinations, no re-rolling the dice.

- **Fast, bounded offline screenshots**: OCR is lazy-loaded, uses a worker where available, caps oversized frames, and has a short native-OCR deadline—so a stalled scanner cannot leave the app spinning forever.
- **Parallel AI fallback**: when the fast direct OCR passes have not found flights after ~1.5s, the Gemini fallback starts *immediately* and races the remaining bounded direct re-reads instead of running after them serially — a screenshot the offline engine cannot read answers in AI-time (not 14.5s-of-local-grinding + AI-time). The deterministic result always wins when both succeed; a junk direct read full of `????` placeholders is auto re-read by AI without a manual press.
- **AI mistake detection & self-learning — that refuses to learn nonsense**: the
  AI's answer is compared to the deterministic one **leg by leg** (same carrier,
  same flight-number digits after look-alike folding, same route, same day), never
  by row position, so a differently-segmented answer can no longer "correct" the
  wrong leg. A rule is only stored when the difference is a genuine scanner
  confusion (`O/0`, `I/1`, `S/5`, `Z/2`, `B/8`, `G/6`, `C/0`, `T/7`), and a rule
  that reverses an existing one cancels both instead of making the tool oscillate.
  Learned rules are applied to **screenshot OCR only** — a typed or pasted
  itinerary is ground truth and is never rewritten.
  A rule store written by the older learner is swept once on load, so already-
  poisoned devices self-heal instead of keeping their contradictory rules.
- **GDS rows are read as tables**: a screenshot of a terminal (or a re-paste of
  this tool's own output) keeps its columns. `15SEP` is no longer split into
  `15 SEP`, the flight-time column `6.10` is no longer mistaken for a clock, the
  sell-status column `HK2`/`TK2` no longer becomes a phantom Turkish leg, a glued
  `MIAVVI` is unrolled into its two airports, and a carrier the data file does
  not know yet (IberoJet `OB`) is still read instead of dropped.
- **`AI FIX` — the repair button, not the default path**: pasting converts on its own, no click needed.
  When that automatic offline pass cannot read an image (handwritten, cropped, garbage-scanned) or only
  half-reads it, `AI FIX` re-reads the same input with Gemini and repairs the result; the deterministic
  answer still wins whenever both succeed. (The previous label read like a mode switch, which made
  people wait for an "auto" that had already run and come back empty.)
- **Reliable attachments**: `+ ATTACH`, drag-and-drop, and clipboard screenshots share one queue; image extensions are detected even when a browser supplies no MIME type, multiple images are parsed together in order, and stale work cannot overwrite a cleared request. Each screenshot has a small red `×` remove button, can be clicked to review full-size, and can also be removed from the review screen.
- **Word-proof carriers**: English words that are also IATA codes (`to`, `by`,
  `at`…) stay words. `to London` / `to Los Angeles` is no longer rewritten as
  a phantom Transavia `TO 105`, and bare `Manchester` is MAN (UK), not MHT.
- **Direction-proof routes**: every leg keeps the origin/destination it was
  pasted with. A route is read whether it sits on a short line or on a long
  Google-Flights card line, whether it is written `(JFK) to Dublin (DUB)`,
  `(JFK) TO Dublin (DUB)`, bare `SZX to DMM`, or after the flight number — so an
  outbound can no longer be printed with the return's airports.
- **Accent-proof cities**: cities are read the way their country spells them —
  `Bogotá`, `Zürich`, `São Paulo`, `Malmö`, `Kraków` — composed or decomposed
  (macOS pastes the latter). An accented letter used to hide a leg's route
  header, so the outbound silently borrowed the return's airports *and* the
  return's date; it no longer can.
- **Card lists keep their clocks**: on a Google-Flights-style card the time pair
  (`3:45 PM to 10:15 AM`) is printed *above* the flight number and below the
  previous leg. One leg used to get it right and every leg after it printed
  `????`; now that standalone line belongs to the flight under it, and only a
  whole line — never the tail of a neighbouring leg's own line.
- **Round-trip returns stay themselves**: `to 105 PM` — a Google-Flights clock
  pair with its colon lost — is a time again, not a phantom Transavia `TO 105`
  that stole the real flight's clocks into `????` (the engine never anchors a
  flight number with a meridiem glued to it). And a return whose own route
  header failed to publish no longer silently wears the outbound's direction:
  when the pasted clocks only add up on the opposite airport pair (1:05 PM →
  6:00 AM in 9h 55m printed as LAX→HND with a nonsense `¥2`), the pair is
  reversed and the row discloses it.
- **Published mileages**: distances are WGS-84 geodesic miles (Vincenty), which
  is what airlines and GDS systems quote. A spherical great circle runs up to
  ~0.5% short on east/west routes — JFK-DUB read 3171 instead of the published
  3179 — and near-antipodal pairs fall back to the spherical value rather than
  failing.
- **Text and PDF attachments**: `.txt`, `.eml`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.html`, `.ics`, and similar text exports are read instantly; PDFs are passed to AI only when the user explicitly supplies a Gemini key.
- **Weekly report**: One-click weekly performance and enhancement reports sent to `adhambadraan@gmail.com` to improve and enhance the tool to the max. Each report covers one week (Monday 00:00 UTC → now), compares it with the previous week, and keeps a separate lifetime total — a closed week is archived, never mixed into the current one. A *conversion* is a result shown to the user: live re-renders while typing and AI replies the direct read beat are counted as neither.
- **About, in one click**: the `About` link leads the status row (`About / Booking Link /
  Generate Api / Weekly Report / Report a bug`) and opens a dialog that says what the engine does, what it
  deliberately refuses to do, and who built it — no marketing, no fluff, `Esc` closes it and
  focus goes back where it was.
- **Booking Link — the checkout button that lights itself green**: beside `About` sits a
  `Booking Link` row link that turns the current converted itinerary into a direct airline
  checkout link (AA metasearch, Delta trip summary, Alaska, United, BA — ported from
  SpicyLinkGenerator and fed with engine segments, never re-typed). Every new result
  re-checks eligibility: a bookable trip (one carrier in AA/DL/AS/UA/BA, every leg complete)
  lights the button terminal-green; anything else (mixed airlines, an unbookable carrier, a
  `????` clock) leaves it dim and its click says why. A click opens the checkout in a new
  tab and copies the link — nothing else, no JSON, no extra screens.
- **Terminal boot animation**: the workspace panes slide in with a quick scanline sweep, the
  ready indicator gently pulses, and the motion automatically turns off for reduced-motion users.
- **Per-line glow bars**: both windows light up line by line — every visible line of INPUT
  carries a cool-blue glowing bar and every line of OUTPUT a terminal-green one. A change
  (keystroke, paste, drop, new result) ignites them one after another so the light visibly
  walks the window, and between changes the same bars keep drifting in a slow wave, so the
  panes stay alive instead of going dark. A strip on an empty line only shimmers, and the
  bars follow resize, rotation, the phone keyboard and scrolling. Reduced-motion users get
  a quiet static glow instead of any animated sweep.
- **OUTPUT always scrolls**: a long itinerary scrolls inside its own window — wheel, keys,
  touch and drag-select. The result's print animation used to leave a text-clipped
  background (`background-clip:text`) on that window, which is the browser bug that can stop
  a scrolling element dead. The whole print is now carried by a short-lived class that app.js
  takes off again the moment the effect ends — and the glyph streak inside it is skipped
  entirely while the window can scroll, and for reduced-motion users — so what you scroll is
  a plain, native scrollport with no clipped paint or leftover filter on it.
- **INPUT wears the OUTPUT scrollbar**: both windows speak one scrollbar language — thin,
  terminal green, on a dark track (the INPUT textarea used to keep whatever bar the browser
  ships). Both bars are always drawn: there is no switch to hide them, and scrolling itself
  is plain native behaviour — wheel, arrow keys, PageUp/PageDown, drag-select and touch.
- 100% offline, private — itineraries and screenshots never leave the browser.
- `???` never appears as an aircraft; inferred values are disclosed.
- Never drops a flight row silently.

## Deploy

The whole app is one static file, built by `npm run build` into
`public/index.html` (an offline copy is also written to the repo root).

- **Vercel**: import this repo — `vercel.json` already sets the build command
  and output directory, so every `git push` to `main` deploys automatically.
- **Netlify from Git**: connect this repo — `netlify.toml` builds and
  publishes `public/`.
- **Netlify Drop**: drag the generated `index.html` onto <https://app.netlify.com/drop>

Only the self-contained app pages are deployed; repository screenshots, source
files and archives are never shipped.
